# 1. Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

Our Online Book Store project is a web-based application developed using Java Spring. It provides a platform for both shoppers and managers to interact with books, shopping carts, orders, and inventory. This project will be developed incrementally, and we will break down the features into manageable parts.
# 2. Entities <a name="entities"></a>

We have identified several domain models (entities) that will be central to our application:

    User: Represents registered users with authentication details and personal information.
    Role: Defines user roles such as admin or regular user.
    Book: Represents books available in the store.
    Category: Classifies books into different categories.
    ShoppingCart: Represents a user's shopping cart.
    CartItem: Represents an item in a user's shopping cart.
    Order: Represents an order placed by a user.
    OrderItem: Represents an item in a user's order.
